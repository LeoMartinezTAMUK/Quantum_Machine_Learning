## Overview  

This project implements a **Quantum Machine Learning (QML)** model using **Pennylane** to classify synthetic data. It leverages quantum variational circuits with angle encoding and gradient-based optimization to perform binary classification tasks. Dimensionality reduction and feature scaling techniques are used to prepare the data for quantum processing.  

---

## Features  

- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Utilizes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce input features to fit quantum processing constraints.  
- **Quantum Circuit Design:** Implements angle encoding and strongly entangling layers for quantum feature processing.  
- **Optimization:** Employs the Adam optimizer to train a hybrid quantum-classical variational classifier.  
- **Metrics:** Outputs evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and balanced accuracy.  

---

## Installation  

### Requirements:  

- **Python**: 3.12.6  
- **Libraries**:
  - `pennylane`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `pandas`  

---

## Workflow  

### 1. Data Preparation  
The project starts by reading a synthetic dataset (`synthetic_data.csv`). PCA reduces the dataset dimensions to 2, and the data is standardized to fit the quantum processing requirements.  

### 2. Quantum Circuit Design  
The quantum circuit uses:  
- **Angle Encoding:** Maps classical data to quantum states.  
- **Strongly Entangling Layers:** Introduces correlations between qubits.  

### 3. Training and Optimization  
- A variational quantum classifier predicts labels by combining quantum circuits with a classical bias term.  
- The classifier minimizes the square loss function using the **Adam Optimizer** with a batch size of 10.  

### 4. Evaluation  
The trained model evaluates the test dataset, outputting metrics such as:  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1 Score  
- Balanced Accuracy  

---

## Usage  

1. **Prepare the Dataset:**  
   Place your synthetic dataset as `data/synthetic_data.csv`.  

2. **Run the Script:**  

3. **View Results:**  
The script will print training progress, final test accuracy, and classification metrics.
